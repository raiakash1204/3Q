## Overview

This project explores building a classic EQ plugin from scratch:

- Implemented using **JUCE** and **modern C++17**
- Learn-to-code audio nodes like **low-cut**, **high-cut**, and **peak filters**
- Fully functional **GUI controls** (sliders, knobs) mapped to DSP backbone
- Compilable as a **VST3/AU plugin** deployable in any DAW or plugin host

Ideal for students and hobbyists diving into C++ Audio Programming.
